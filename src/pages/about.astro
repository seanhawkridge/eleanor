      <p>
        I'm Eleanor, a designer and creative director with a passion for building brands that resonate. With over a decade of experience spanning identity design, digital product design, and art direction, I help companies tell their stories through thoughtful visual systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach starts with understanding — the audience, the market, and the core values that make each project unique. From there, I craft design solutions that are both beautiful and purposeful.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not designing, you'll find me exploring galleries, experimenting with film photography, or hiking somewhere with poor cell reception.
